# kobe's Shot Selection (Machine Learning Project)

Collaborated by Chaoran Wei and Wei Xia, this repository dedicates to solve one of the Machine Learning problem posted by Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection). 
The code attempts to predict whether one of Kobe Bryant's shot is a shot or miss.

The code uses XGBoost algorithm to make prediction with extensive data cleaning, exploritory data analysis and feature selections. The project results in top 10% in this Kaggle Competition.
